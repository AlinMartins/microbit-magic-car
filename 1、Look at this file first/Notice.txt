1. It is recommended to test and adjust the steering gear Angle after the car is installed.
As a result of different installation, there will be some errors in the steering gear Angle. If after installing the car and downloading the routine program, it is found that the building blocks driven by the car steering gear do not rotate to the corresponding position, the steering gear Angle value can be changed through the program to test the position of the car steering gear rotation, so as to obtain more accurate Angle value and achieve better experimental effect.
Such as the Angle of steering gear set for 100, as a result, download the program and found the location of the bucket or other building blocks is too high, then the Angle adjustment is 80 and found that a higher position after download, explanation Angle values should be the major (if the position is low, should be to minor), transferred to the steering gear rotation after 120, download the ideal position.
2. Pay attention to the positive and negative direction of pins in the circuit board, and pay special attention to the positive and negative direction when installing the battery
